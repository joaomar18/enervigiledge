class HTTPDependencies:
    """
    Dependency injection container for HTTP server service components.

    This class manages the lifecycle and access to core service components
    used by the FastAPI HTTP server. It provides a centralized way to inject
    dependencies into route handlers and other components.

    The container follows a singleton-like pattern where dependencies are
    initialized once during server startup and then accessed throughout
    the application lifecycle via getter methods.

    Attributes:
        safety (HTTPSafety | None): Security and authentication service
        device_manager (DeviceManager | None): Device lifecycle management service
        db (SQLiteDBClient | None): SQLite database client for configuration data
        timedb (TimeDBClient | None): InfluxDB client for time-series data
